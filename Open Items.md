  1. How can the total page hits be verified in every page
  2. Does the page size tell me hwo many channels or schedules are listed in the page?
  3. Is it relevent to conduct Test Case 5? 

- Scope for this project 
  1. This TestSuite must be integrated with a tool like Jenkins for automated execution or triggered by a scheduled batch file.
  2. Each Test Result types can be logged into seperate files for better maintainability.
